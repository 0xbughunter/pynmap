# PyNMAP

## Installation

Clone the repo 
https://github.com/noobpythonist/pynmap.git
and install the pip packages available in the requirement.txt file

## Requirement

Need to have nmap and python 2.7 installed in an Ubuntu machine

## Usage

Need to trigger the tool by providing sudo permission, reason being a few nmap commands executes through higher privileges.
This tool can be used while performing scans on an IP Address / a set of IP(s), hence being beneficial for Infra as well as Web App Pentest.
